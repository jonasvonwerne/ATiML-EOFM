# Practical Experiment for Earth Observation Foundation Model
This repository provides experiments with the following foundation models for Earth Observation (EO):
- TerraMind 1.0 Base
- TerraMind 1.0 Base TIM
- Prithvi-EO-2.0

Each experiment is implemented in a dedicated Jupyter notebook and demonstrates fine-tuning experiments on the [Sen1Floods11](https://github.com/cloudtostreet/Sen1Floods11) dataset using [TerraTorch](https://github.com/IBM/terratorch).
