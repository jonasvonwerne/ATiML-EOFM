# Practical Experiment for Earth Observation Foundation Model
This repository provides experiments with the following foundation models for Earth Observation (EO):
- TerraMind 1.0 Base
- TerraMind 1.0 Base TIM
- Prithvi-EO-2.0

Each experiment is implemented in a dedicated Jupyter notebook and demonstrates fine-tuning experiments on the [Sen1Floods11](https://github.com/cloudtostreet/Sen1Floods11) dataset using [TerraTorch](https://github.com/IBM/terratorch).

## Repository Folder Structure
- **/notebooks** (Contains all Jupyter experiment notebooks.)

  - **/notebooks/original** (Raw notebooks used during testing and experimentation. These may include interactive widgets, which are not rendered on GitHubâ€™s web interface.)
  - **/notebooks/web_preview/** (Cleaned versions of the notebooks. These are stripped of widget metadata so they can be viewed directly in GitHub without downloading.)

- **/outputs/** (Includes link to model checkpoint files)
